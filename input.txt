This comment is not interpreted, so store any extra info here.
Keywords are case insensitive. Look at the help below.
IMPORTANT: avoid the use of '2d' and '3d' in the names of species, transition states and reactions
(these strings are employed when generating the 2d and 3d files of the molecules)
If you want to use 3D coordinates, store them in a xyz/ directory in the same directory as the python script

This example is based on figure 1 in the article: 
J ZÃ¡dor et al.  Phys Chem Chem Phys 11 (46), 11040-11053. 2009 Oct 13.

File follows the rules of SD file format for keywords. Keywords are case
insensitive when parsed.
Keywords:
units: units of the energies supplied above

usexyz: use the xyz coordinates of all the species and render a 2D/3D depiction

rescale: energies are rescaled relative to the energy of the species given here 

wells: all the wells of the PES, separated by lines
each line contains the name, the energy, and optionally the smiles

bimolec: all the bimolecular products of the PES, separated by lines
each line contains the name, the energy, and optionally the smiles of both bimolecular products

ts: all the transition states of the PES, separated by lines
each line contains the name, the energy, and the names of the reactant and product

barrierless: all the barrierless reactions of the PES, separated by lines
each line contains the name and the names of the reactant and product
